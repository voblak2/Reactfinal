# ReactFinal
React Final for Bethel School of Technology/Woz-U


Setup
For this project, you will be working with the React/Redux counter you created in Lesson 8.

Download this counter starter project here, add it to your FEFReact directory and rename it to be L10HandsOn.
Once the project has downloaded, don't forget to run npm install.
This counter project is structured differently than how you built it in the lesson, but does the exact same thing.
This project includes the separate folders and files for the actions, components and reducers.
You will be adding more functionality to this project, as you will see from the below requirements.
Requirements
Step 1
Remove the Reset button and its functionality.

Step 2
Add the functionality which counts the number of clicks made to both the increment and decrement buttons. - This number should show on the page with a label.

Step 3
Add an input field where the user can input a number. Next to the input should be a button. When the button is clicked, the original increment and decrement count should reset to the number that was inputted and the number of clicks should reset to zero. - The number should not add onto the number that was created by clicking the increment and decrement buttons. The number listed should show the exact number inputted.

Step 4
Your project should end up looking similar to the example below. - Based on the above image, when the Change Count Number button is clicked, the number 4 will be replaced with 33 and the number 12 will be replaced with 0.
